- Generated reports on uptime, throughput, and device status  
- Conducted periodic audits to ensure optimal performance  

### 3. 🔐 Network Security

- Configured firewalls and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict unauthorized access  
- Deployed Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)  
- Implemented VPNs for secure remote access  
- Applied port security and MAC filtering on switches  
- Conducted vulnerability scans and supported penetration testing  

### 4. 🧑‍💻 User Access & Policy Enforcement

- Managed user authentication via Active Directory and RADIUS  
- Applied role-based access control (RBAC) across network resources  
- Enforced password policies and account lockout thresholds  
- Logged and reviewed access attempts and system changes  

### 5. 🔄 Maintenance & Documentation
