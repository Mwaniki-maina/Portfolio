# 🧵 Cable Management & Labeling Project

This project documents the structured cable management and labeling process carried out to improve network traceability, reduce troubleshooting time, and enhance the overall organization of the IT infrastructure. The work involved physical cable arrangement, tagging, and verification using a network cable tester.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Organize and secure network cables in server rooms and access points
- Label cables for quick identification and tracing
- Test cable integrity and connectivity using a network cable tester
- Ensure compliance with structured cabling standards

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Materials Used

- **Cable Tags**: Color-coded and numbered for identification  
- **Velcro Straps & Cable Ties**: For bundling and securing cables  
- **Cable Management Panels**: Horizontal and vertical organizers  
- **Network Cable Tester**: For verifying continuity, pinout, and signal integrity  
- **Label Printer**: For durable and legible cable tags

## ⚙️ Implementation Steps

### 1. 📦 Preparation
- Assessed existing cable layout and identified tangled or unmarked cables
- Planned cable routing paths based on rack layout and switch placement

### 2. 🧹 Physical Management
- Removed redundant or unused cables
- Bundled cables using Velcro straps to avoid over-tightening
- Routed cables through cable trays and management panels

### 3. 🏷️ Labeling
- Printed and attached cable tags at both ends of each cable
- Used a consistent naming convention (e.g., `SW1-Port01-PC01`)
- Documented cable map for future reference

### 4. 🔍 Testing & Verification
- Used a network cable tester to:
  - Check for continuity and correct pin configuration
  - Identify faulty or miswired cables
- Replaced or re-terminated cables as needed
