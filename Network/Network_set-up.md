# 🌐 Network Infrastructure Deployment Project

This project outlines the successful implementation of a robust and scalable network infrastructure for [Organization Name]. The deployment included physical and logical setup of networking components, fiber installation, and VLAN configuration to support secure and efficient communication across the institution.

---

## 🧭 Project Objectives

- Establish a reliable and high-speed network backbone
- Enable secure segmentation of services and departments via VLANs
- Ensure future scalability and maintainability of the network
- Provide stable internet and intranet connectivity across the institution

## 🛠️ Tasks Completed

### 1. 🏗️ Network Setup
- Designed and implemented the full network topology
- Mapped out device connectivity and IP addressing scheme
- Verified link integrity and throughput across all segments

### 2. 🔌 Fiber Installation & Splicing
- Assisted in laying fiber optic cables across key campus zones
- Performed fiber splicing to ensure minimal signal loss
- Tested fiber links using OTDR and light source tools

### 3. 🗄️ Network Cabinet Setup
- Installed structured network cabinets in designated server and access rooms
- Organized patch panels, cable management trays, and power units
- Labeled and documented all connections for future maintenance

### 4. 📡 Router & Switch Configuration
- Configured core and edge routers with appropriate routing protocols
- Set up managed switches with trunk and access ports
- Enabled STP and port security features for redundancy and protection

### 5. 🧩 VLAN Creation
- Created VLANs for departments (e.g., Admin, Finance, Labs, Students)
- Assigned VLAN IDs and configured inter-VLAN routing
- Applied access control policies to isolate sensitive traffic
